     <h3> Videos format </h3>
     
        <p> The videos are in .mp4 format with x264 encoding. 
                 They were encoded as .avi/mpeg using mencoder, then converted
                 to .mp4/x264 with ffmpeg.
             They should 
              play on any recent player, so let us know if it doesn't work for you. 
              Players that are known to work include:

- id: LaserDisplay
  short: Visualization of laser data.
  long: |
    This video displays the laser data obtained by the two Sick range finders mounted at
    approximately 0deg and 180deg with respect to the robot front.
    
    On the right, the raw readings are displayed by a simple plot. The first 181
    readings are from the front laser, and the rest from the back laser.
    
    On the left, the laser readings are plotted in polar form superimposed to the
    data from the omnidirectional camera. (Note that the alignment is only approximative).
    
    In both cases the maximum distance is capped at 20m (for visualization purposes)

- id: LaserCorr
  short: Second-order statistics of laser data.
  long: |
     This video displays some second-order statistics of the laser data, namely
     the sample covariance of the readings (left), of the readings derivative (center),
     and of the sign of the readings derivative (right). 
     
     Eventually, when averaged
     over long trajectories in various environments, all of the three statistics are
     a function of the distance between the sensels. However, their convergence
     properties varies.
     Case in point, the covariance of the readings is slow to converge because
     the robot is driven along stereotypical trajectories (e.g., straight in the middle
     of a corridor).
     Instead, the derivative of the readings converges faster (informally,
     deriving something tends to get rid of the slow phenomena).
     
     We also show the statistics of the sign of the derivative (cov(sign(dy/dt))) 
     to make the point that simple nonlinearities can alter dramatically the
     convergence speed. In this case, taking the sign mitigates the effects of
     the abrupt changes in the readings signal.

- id: LaserBDSLearning
  short: BDS tensors learning for laser data.
  long: |
     This video shows the realtime learning of the BDS tensors (in the paper, indicated by the symbol T).  We consider two commands: linear and angular velocity. Therefore, T is a N x N x 2 
     tensor, with N the number of readings. The two N x N slices are shown here side by side.
     
     Note how the angular velocity slice converges faster than the other. This is due
     to the trajectories in which the robot is driven. Seen as a linear operator,
     this part of the tensor is equivalent to a gradient operator followed by smoothing.
     (the amount of smoothing depends on the environment covariance).
     
     In the end, the linear velocity slice converges as well and appears very similar to
     the results we obtain in simulation. Seen as a linear operator, it can be 
     considered a gradient operator + smoothing, multiplied by a cosine.
