Notes 
======


These are some personal notes how all of this works. 


1. Run ``be_all``. It expects to be run in the base directory of rawseeds ::

	$ ls
    Bicocca_2009-02-25a/ 
	Bicocca_2009-02-26a/ 
	...
	$ be_all

The output goes into a subdirectory of the log directories. The convention is: ::


    Bicocca_2009-02-25a/out/<experiment>/<configuration>/file 



2. Run 



Indices and tables
==================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
