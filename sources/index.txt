Bootstrapping experiments
=========================

This package contains the source code for some experiments I'm running during summer-fall 2010.
One day (when the next paper gets submitted) everything will be documented, but it is not yet.
Nevertheless this page is up for my own reference and for occasionally pointing some material
to coworkers.
